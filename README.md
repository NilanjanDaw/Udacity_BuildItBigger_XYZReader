# Udacity_MakeYourAppMaterial_XYZReader

## Description
It is the 5th project in the Android Nanodegree Programme.

Transformed the user experience of a news reading app using Material Design principles. This includes consistent and meaningful use of Material Design UI components, fonts, color, motion and surfaces.

## Rubrics

- App uses the Design Support library and its provided widget types (FloatingActionButton, AppBarLayout, SnackBar, etc).

- App uses CoordinatorLayout for the main Activity.

- App theme extends from AppCompat.

- App uses an AppBar and associated Toolbars.

- App provides a Floating Action Button for the most common action(s).

- App properly specifies elevations for app bars, FABs, and other elements specified in the Material Design specification.

- App has a consistent color theme defined in styles.xml. Color theme does not impact usability of the app.

- App provides sufficient space between text and surrounding elements.

- App uses images that are high quality, specific, and full bleed.

- App uses fonts that are either the Android defaults, are complementary, and aren't otherwise distracting.
